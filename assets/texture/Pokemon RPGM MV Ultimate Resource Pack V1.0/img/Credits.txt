 ~First and foremost; I do NOT own any of these assets. They belong to Game Freak and Nintendo. And about 90% of these were ripped by other people. I only converted them for use into RPG Maker MV. If you are stupid enough to use these in a commercial product instead of Fan Games like they are intended, you deserve whatever happens afterwords.~
